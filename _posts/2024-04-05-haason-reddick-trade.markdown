I know I'm a bit late to the party, but I've been pretty busy this past week. As you can tell from the title, I really don't like the Haason Reddick trade. The Eagle's achilles heal is their defense, and Haason Reddick is one of their best guys on defense. When the Eagles played the Cardinals, they choked at the end because the defense let a 4 win offense score 29 points IN A HALF! The offense did their best, scoring 31 points, but the defense gave up 35. They were starting to look promising on offense, signing Saquon Barkley, but the defense will never be able to protect a lead!
