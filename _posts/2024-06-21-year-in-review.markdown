It's been a while since I've posted to this blog, and a lot has happened. I went to my school's dance(with my friends). I was promoted to high school. And most of all, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. I can remember the first day of middle school, unable to recognize anybody in this daunting new environment. But in the end, I was changed for the better. For example, I became friends with some of the most amazing people I have ever met. Then, we founded a coding club together. Training the people(no, not with gradient descent) who would succeed us was a tough expirience, as I realized the brevity of my coming of age. I want to thank my friends and teachers for sharing the past year with me.
