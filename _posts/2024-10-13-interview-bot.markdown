It's been a while since my last post! Recently, I have been working on an app called Interview Bot. I am using the OpenAI Realtime API to simulate a phone call with an interviewer. At the end of the mock interview, the AI will write the user some feedback so they can improve their skills. Sign up for the waitlist [here](http://interview-bot-psi.vercel.app/).
